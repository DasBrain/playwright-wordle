# playwright-wordle
Automates the [wordle game](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) using [playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

Idea by [Tom Cools](https://www.twitch.tv/tomcools).  
[Tom Cools implementation](https://github.com/TomCools/playwright-wordle).

The wordlist contains words that wordle doesn't recognize.  
Could be trimmed, probably should be.
